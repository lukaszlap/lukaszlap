👋 Hi, I’m @lukaszlap
👀 I’m interested in multimodal languages and creating applications using language models both locally and through APIs such as OpenAI, Gemini, and Claude. I also work with local models from Hugging Face.
🌱 I’m currently learning about data processing and automation of processes.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving Python, C#, web development (HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, PHP, Flask), and database integration (e.g., MySQL).
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to reach out via my GitHub profile.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I'm working on an application for scanning receipts using various technologies like OCR, GPT-4-O (Vision), GPT-3.5 Turbo, local models like Mistral and LLaMA, Flutter Flow for mobile applications, and a Flask backend.
